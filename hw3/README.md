# Submission for HW3 by Miguel Gomez

All the work needed to run the files is shown in line with all my work in the .org file submitted. This file serves as a README as well as a structure needed to build the PDF latex output that I have for turnin.

- All sing files under sing are used in the assignment except the ones from examples given by professor
- All images are contained in the images dir but can be viewed inline in the PDF
- All verilog files are contained within the verilog dir 
- All testbenches and logs produced are in testbenches the dir
- lib contains my libraries that I was working on and should work fine as long as the paths in the singular files are update to the ABSOLUTE PATH ON YOUR MACHINE!!! I was unable to get the linking for relative paths working in Singular. Probably because I was hacking away at the source code a bit too much and messed some stuff up. 


Bulk of my work can easily be graded from within the PDF file alone. Most if not all relevant parts are detailed, along with the instructions at bash terminal needed to run my work. 

If for some reason, you run into any problems attempting to get this working, PLEASE REACH OUT!! I know I have a bit of a strange workflow compared to most, but it works well, I swear.
