* HW files for HW2
- all testbenches are in verilog->testbenches
- quartus related files are in the quartus directory
- HW2_main.[tex|pdf|org|toc] are the files used to make the hw latex output from org mode to latex.

  The easiest way to understand how to run the code I made is to look at the SRC blocks in the org file. they have the commands necessary to run the code from the parent directory where the org file is.

  I know this method of submitting and organizing homework is unconventional, so please let me know if you have any difficulties with my files. They should run fine, but I would like a chance to explain further if there are any issues with it.

  Thank you!!!
